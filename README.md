# Restaurant Table Reservation App üçΩÔ∏è
## Overview
This Swift UIkit app serves as the front-end for a table reservation system. More details about BE [here](https://github.com/tatkagore/booking-v-2).

App implements the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture to manage the table reservation system. It interacts with a Node.js backend built with Express and PostgreSQL, providing a structured approach to handling user interactions, business logic, and data management.

### MVP Architecture
The app is structured around the Model-View-Presenter architecture, which divides responsibilities as follows:
- **Model:** Represents data entities and manages the interaction with the backend API for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **View:** Displays the user interface and communicates user actions to the presenter.
- **Presenter:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user inputs, updating the model, and updating the view accordingly.

## Features
- **Reservation Management:** Users can view, create, update, and delete reservations through a well-defined MVP structure.
- **Backend Connectivity:** Utilizes the MVP pattern to connect seamlessly with the Node.js backend via RESTful API endpoints for efficient data operations.


### Backend Integration
The app seamlessly integrates with the backend created using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It leverages the backend's API endpoints for functionalities like creating, updating, and deleting reservations.
